Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy – if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins.

Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins-1 hr or until almost doubled in size.",

Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl, until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",

Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 20 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. When baked, drizzle with a little extra olive oil.",

      "Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1½ tsp fine salt in a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a tabletop mixer. Measure out 300ml warm water and add roughly 280ml to the flour, along with the olive oil, and start mixing until the ingredients start to clump together as a dough. If the dough seems a little dry, add the remaining water. Once combined, knead for 10 mins by hand on your work surface, or for 5 mins on a medium speed in a mixer. The dough is ready when it feels soft, springy and elastic. Clean the bowl, drizzle in a little oil, then pop the dough back in, turning it over and coating the sides of the bowl in oil. Cover with some oiled cling film and set aside in a warm place to double in size – this will take 1-3 hrs, depending on the temperature.",
      "Line a baking tray with parchment. Uncover the dough and punch it down a couple of times with your fist, knocking out all the air bubbles. Tip out onto a floured work surface and dust the top with a little flour too, if it is sticky. Roll the dough out to a rectangle, roughly 40 x 30cm. Spread the pesto over the dough, then scatter over the tomatoes, both cheeses and the basil. Roll the dough up from one of the longer sides, into a long sausage.",
      "Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even pieces. Place on the baking tray, cut-side up, in a 3-by-4 formation, making sure the open end of each roll is tucked in towards the centre on the arrangement – this will prevent them from uncoiling during cooking. Leave a little space between each roll as they will grow and touch as they prove. Loosely cover with oiled cling film and leave to prove for 30 mins–1 hr until almost doubled in size again. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "Uncover the bread when it is puffed up. Bake on the middle shelf in the oven for 35-40 mins until golden brown and the centre looks dry and not doughy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 10 mins.",

    ingredients: [
      "200g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting",
      "50g butter, softened",
      "1 tsp paprika",
      "100-125ml/3½-4fl oz milk",
      "50g ready-grated  mature cheddar",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub them together with your fingers. Rubbing in mixture with cold butter is hard and tiring on young fingers, so use slightly softened butter – but not so soft that it is oily. Now stir in the paprika and mix again.",
      "Add 100ml milk and mix with a fork until you get a soft dough. Add a splash more milk if the dough is dry. This process will teach you how to feel the dough and decide if it needs more liquid. You can always add more milk if required.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough like pastry to about 0.5cm thick. Try to keep a rectangular shape. Only roll in one direction, and roll and turn, roll and turn – by keeping the dough moving, you avoid finding it stuck at the end.",
      "Sprinkle the grated cheese on top, then roll up like a sausage along the long side. Cut into 12 thick rings using a table knife. Get an adult to show you how to hold the dough with one hand and cut straight through with the other.",
      "Line the baking tray with baking parchment. Place the roll-ups on the parchment, cut-side down, almost touching each other, making sure that you can see the spiral. Get an adult to put them in the oven for you and bake for 20-25 mins until golden and melty. Ask an adult to remove them from the oven, then leave to cool. The cheese roll-ups will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container.",

    ingredients: [
      "250g strong white bread flour",
      "1 tsp salt",
      "1 tsp caster sugar",
      "1 tsp (5g) fast-action dried yeast",
      "100g sesame seeds",
      "1 tbsp pomegranate molasses or molasses syrup",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Tip the flour, salt and sugar into a bowl and mix together. Add the yeast and 150ml warm water, mix, then knead for a few mins to bring everything together into a soft dough. Tip onto your work surface and continue kneading for 10-12 mins until the dough feels stretchy. Return to a clean bowl, cover and leave to rise for an hour or two until doubled in size.",
      "Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until golden. Set aside in the pan. Mix the molasses syrup or pomegranate molasses with 50ml water in a wide shallow bowl.",
      "Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll each into a sausage about 45cm long. Flip the rope of dough back on itself then twist the two strands and loop into a ring, squeezing the ends together to secure. Once shaped, dip each piece into the molasses water, turning to coat, then into the sesame seeds, making sure each one is well covered. Transfer to a baking tray, cover and leave to prove for another 45 mins-1 hr. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "When the breads have puffed up, uncover them and bake for 15-18 mins until golden. Cool, then wrap in a tea towel to keep them fresh. Can be made up to a day ahead and warmed gently before serving.",
